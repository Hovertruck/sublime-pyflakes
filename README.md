Sublime Text 2 Pyflakes Plugin
==============================
This is a Sublime Text 2 package that will run Pyflakes against Python files being edited and highlight the warnings returned.

Requirements
------------
The package requires Pyflakes to already be installed and in a place where Python can find it, e.g. ```/usr/bin```

Installation

Just drop pyflakes.py into ```Sublime Text 2/Packages/User```. The package will run every time a Python file is saved.
